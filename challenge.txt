As the Hint includes the octopus loves texting, this indicates that the cyber attack has been done on a network of systems 
which has been done simultaneously. This is pretty much similar to the 'botnet' attacking technique which means an entire 
network of computers controlled and instructed to attack other systems and send spam or phishing emails etc.

Now, to find out the vulnerability exploited, we can look in the temp folder, if there are many newly created files then 
that means that your system might have been hacked.
 
Mostly hackers use an alternate IP address using some paid softwares which provide them with IP addresses from around 
the world. For eg you can be alloted an IP address of USA even if you are working in INDIA with the help of paid softwares.
So, to find the attacker we can pay the software company and work out a deal to get the original IP addresses from which our
databases were attacked and then we can easily find the hacker.

Sometimes hackers do simple mistakes by using their personal details like email-id during the cyber attack. This can lead
to the hacker very easily.

The code used by the attacker may include some comments which can tell us about their language. We can analyse the code
to gather more information like the time at which the code was compiled. So, it can be used to determine the attackers 
location.
