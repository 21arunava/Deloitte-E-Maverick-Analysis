The beep beep sound is usually caused by a virus residing in the system. Although this is not always the case, but mostly 
this happens when we download a file from an unknown source and the file contains a malware. Nowadays, it is very difficult
to get these types of virus into the system as our systems and applications can sense virus and hence warn us regarding
the same.
For eg Google Chrome :-
Whenever we click on a link which is not an authorised link, google chrome warns us by displaying a security check web page
and warns us that proceeding further may cause problems in the system. Hence, most users prefer not to proceed and thus are
saved from inhering a virus into their system.

As the hint includes CH3COOH which is very dangerous acid, similarly we can say that these kind of cyber attacks are 
extremely dangerous to our system and can damage our system files completely.
